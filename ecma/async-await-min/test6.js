/*
Browser Support

Async/Await is already available in most major browsers.
This excludes only IE11 - all other vendors will recognize your async/await code
without the need of external libraries.

Node developers can also enjoy the improved async flow
as long as they are on Node 8 or newer.
It should become LTS later this year.

If this compatibility doesn't satisfy you,
there are also several JS transpilers like Babel and TypeScript,
and the Node.js library asyncawait that
offer their own cross-platform versions of the feature.
